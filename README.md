## Project Summary

-   SCSS used for styling.
-   `bootstrap-grid` system used for containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
-   `prop-types` used for type validation and providing defaultProps.
-   `eslint` (airbnb, react-hooks, recommended) and `prettier` used for better coding quality.
-   `React.lazy()` used for code-splitting to improve initial page load performance and reduce time-to-first-paint.
